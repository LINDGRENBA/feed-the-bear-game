Feed the Bear specifications:

Add a mood atribute to our bear object

Add set interval that increases the bears mood over time until it reaches 10

When bear's mood level reaches ten it attacks

Create a backScratch function that will temporarily decrease the bears mood

Create a sleep state for our bear object where it no longer needs to be fed or scratched for a period of time before he wakes up. This "hibernation" state will execute after a certain number of feeds and scratches

After each time the bear hibernatine the bear gets hungrier faster

After each time the bear hibernatine the bear gets angrier faster

Create a hibernation count so that if the user is still hanging on after a predetermined amount of levels, they win!

  test('mood level should be increasing by one everysecond')
