Feed the Bear specifications:

1. Add a mood atribute to our bear object

2. Add set interval that increases the bears mood over time until it reaches 10

3. When bear's mood level reaches ten it attacks

4. Create a backScratch function that will temporarily decrease the bears mood

5. Count each time the bear is scratched and fed

. Create a sleep state for our bear object where it no longer needs to be fed or scratched for a period of time before he wakes up. This "hibernation" state will execute after a certain number of feeds and scratches

. Count each time the bear has hibernated

. After each time the bear hibernatines the bear gets hungrier faster

. After each time the bear hibernatines the bear gets angrier faster

. After each time the bear's hibernation gets shorter and shorter

. After a certain amount of survived hibernation the user wins. Yay!
